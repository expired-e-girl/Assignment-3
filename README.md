Bulls and Cows guess game

Bulls and Cows is an old code-breaking mind game. For this question, you will write a Java program that
implements a game of Bulls and Cows in which the player needs to guess a randomly generated secret 4-
digits number. When the player takes a guess, the program reveals the number of digits that match with
the secret number. If the matching digits are in the correct positions, they are called “bulls”, ifthey
are in different positions, they are called “cows”. After each guess, the program reveals how many bulls
and cows the player’s guess contains.
